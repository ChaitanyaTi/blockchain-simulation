# 🧱 Blockchain Simulation Project

This repository contains a mini blockchain simulation in Python. It demonstrates core blockchain concepts including block linking, Proof-of-Work mining, and consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS).

## 📁 Files Included

- `blockchain_simulation.py`: Simulates a blockchain with 3 linked blocks.
- `mining_simulation.py`: Simulates Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.
- `consensus_demo.py`: Compares PoW, PoS, and DPoS.
- `blockchain_theory.md`: Theoretical concepts and explanations.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## 🧪 Run the Simulations

```bash
python blockchain_simulation.py
python mining_simulation.py
python consensus_demo.py
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understand immutability in blockchain.
- Experience PoW mining effort.
- Compare consensus mechanisms.
